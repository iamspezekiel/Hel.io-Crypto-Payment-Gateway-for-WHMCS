```

### Step 3: Set File Permissions

Ensure proper file permissions (typically 644):

```bash
chmod 644 /path/to/whmcs/modules/gateways/helio.php
chmod 644 /path/to/whmcs/modules/gateways/callback/helio.php
```

3. Find "Hel.io Crypto Gateway" in the list
4. Click **Activate**

### Step 2: Configure Gateway Settings

Fill in the following configuration fields:

## üîß How It Works

### Payment Flow

1. **Invoice Generation**: Customer receives an invoice with Hel.io as payment option
2. **Payment Initiation**: Customer clicks "Pay with Crypto via Hel.io"
3. **Widget Display**: Hel.io's popup widget opens with payment details
4. **Crypto Payment**: Customer completes payment using their preferred cryptocurrency
5. **Webhook Notification**: Hel.io sends payment confirmation to your webhook URL
6. **Invoice Update**: WHMCS automatically marks the invoice as paid
7. **Customer Redirect**: Customer is redirected back to WHMCS with confirmation

### Security Features

- **Signature Verification**: All webhooks are verified using HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- **Transaction Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate payment processing
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all incoming data
- **Error Logging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting and audit purposes

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Custom Styling

The payment interface includes default styling, but you can customize it by modifying the CSS in the `helio_link()` function within `helio.php`.

### Webhook Events

Currently supported events:
- `payment.success` - Payment completed successfully
- Other events are logged but ignored

### Error Handling

The module includes comprehensive error handling:
- Invalid signatures return HTTP 401
- Missing data returns HTTP 400
- Processing errors return HTTP 500
- All errors are logged for debugging

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Payments not updating invoices**
- Verify webhook URL is correctly configured in Hel.io
- Check webhook secret matches between WHMCS and Hel.io
- Review WHMCS activity logs for error messages

**2. JavaScript widget not loading**
- Ensure `https://pay.hel.io/v1/pay.js` is accessible
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify public key is correctly configured

**3. Webhook signature verification failing**
- Confirm webhook secret is identical in both systems
- Check for extra whitespace in configuration fields
- Verify Hel.io is sending the `X-HELIO-SIGNATURE` header

### Debugging

1. **Enable Debug Logging**: Check WHMCS Activity Log under **Utilities ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Module Log**
2. **Webhook Testing**: Use Hel.io's webhook testing tools to verify connectivity
3. **JavaScript Console**: Check browser console for client-side errors
